# Water Jug Challenge 

Application that solve the classic Water Jug Riddle. The challenge involves using two jugs with
different capacities (X gallons and Y gallons) to measure exactly Z gallons of water.
This application have a user interface (UI) that displays the state changes of each jug (Empty, Full, or Partially Full) as it progresses towards the solution.

## Algorithmic Approach
The algorithmic approach used in the application is based on the manipulation of volumes of water in two jars to achieve a target quantity, represented by the measurementZ parameter. Below is a brief explanation of the mathematical theory behind the Transfer() method and MeasureTheQuantityZinBothJugs():
- Transfer(): Performs the transfer of water between two jugs, represented by this (the jug from which the water is transferred) and otherJug (the jug from which the water is transferred). The transfer can occur in two directions depending on the value of condition. If condition is 0, it means that the current jug is transferring water to otherJug. In this case, the total volume of otherJug is subtracted from the current volume of the current jug. If condition is different from 0, it means that the transfer occurs from otherJug to the current jug, so the current volume of the current jug is added to the current volume of otherJug.
- MeasureTheQuantityZinBothJugs(): this method follows an iterative approach to manipulate the jugs to achieve the desired quantity. It performs three main functions:
   - This method starts by checking which of the two jugs (jugX or jugY) offers a more efficient solution to achieve measurementZ. This is done by calling the CheckMostEfficientSolution method of validationController, which is expected to return true if jugX is the most efficient solution and false if jugY is. Depending on the result of the previous verification, the algorithm follows different paths:
     - If jugY is the most efficient solution, jugY is filled and a series of water transfers are performed between jugY and jugX until jugY contains exactly measurementZ.
     - If jugX is the most efficient solution, jugX is filled and a series of water transfers are performed between jugX and jugY until jugX contains exactly measurementZ.

- Inside while loops are used to continue filling or emptying the jars until the quantity measurementZ is reached. At each iteration of the loop, records are added to a list to keep a record of the actions taken.

## Test Cases for Validation
- Test case 1:
   - Initial setup:
     - jugX has a total volume of 5 units.
     - jugY has a total volume of 3 units.
     - measurementZ is 4 units.
   - Expected result: the algorithm is expected to use jugX as the most efficient solution. jugX is expected to fill and then transfer to jugY until jugX contains exactly 4 units. jugY is expected to remain empty.
   - Validation: when inspecting the generated lists recording the actions, one should verify that jugX contains 4 units at the end, while jugY remains empty.
   - Additional check: measurementZ is expected to be divisible by the volume of jugX or jugY, which means that there will be no remainder when dividing measurementZ by the volume of the jug used. In this case, measurementZ must be divisible by the volume of jugX (5) since jugX is filled first.

- Test case 2:
   - Initial setup:
     - jugX has a total volume of 6 units.
     - jugY has a total volume of 3 units.
     - measurementZ is 5 units.
   - Expected result:the algorithm is expected to use jugY as the most efficient solution. jugY is expected to fill and then transfer to jugX until jugY contains exactly 5 units. jugX is expected to remain empty.
   - Validation: when reviewing the generated lists, one should verify that jugY contains 5 units at the end, while jugX remains empty.
   - Additional check: measurementZ is expected to be divisible by the volume of jugX or jugY, which means that there will be no remainder when dividing measurementZ by the volume of the jug used. In this case, measurementZ must be divisible by the volume of jugY (3) since jugY is filled first.

- Test case 3:
   - Initial setup:
     - jugX has a total volume of 7 units.
     - jugY has a total volume of 5 units.
     - measurementZ is 9 units.
   - Expected result:It is expected that the algorithm will not find a valid solution due to the configuration of the jars and the target quantity. An error message is expected to be provided indicating that measurementZ should not be greater than the volume of any of the jars.
   - Validation: when validating error messages generated by the ValidateInputsEntered method, you should verify that the failure to find a solution for this configuration is correctly reported.
   - Additional check: it is expected that measurementZ is not divisible by either the volume of jugX or the volume of jugY, which means that there will be a remainder when dividing measurementZ by the volume of any jug. This is checked with the CheckIfZisDivisibleByXorY method. Additionally, measurementZ must be greater than the volumes of both jars, which is checked with the CheckIfZisGreaterThanXorY method.

- Test case 4:
   - Initial setup:
     - jugX has a total volume of 6 units.
     - jugY has a total volume of 4 units.
     - measurementZ is "5" (character string).
   - Expected result: it is expected that the algorithm will not find a valid solution because one of the input values ​​is not an integer. An error message is expected to be provided indicating that all entries must be integers and greater than zero.
   - Validation: when validating error messages generated by the ValidateInputsEntered method, you should verify that the need to enter valid values ​​is correctly reported.
   - Additional check: measurementZ is expected to not be an integer, which is checked with the CheckIfTheInputIsAnInteger method.
